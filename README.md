# Jungle

A mini e-commerce application built with Rails 4.2 for purposes of teaching Rails by example, and an assigned project during Lighthouse Labs' (lighthouselabs.ca) Web Developer Bootcamp. Numerous major and minor enhancements are sought, so with limited time for the project, a developer decides which to implement.

These features have been implemented:
1)  A Sold Out badge is shown on any product whose stock level is zero,
2)  A user can add new product categories, and add products to categories.
3)  A visitor can register (and continue) as a user; users can login or out, and the current user's displayed.
