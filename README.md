# Jungle

A mini e-commerce application built with Rails 4.2 for purposes of teaching Rails by example, and an assigned project during Lighthouse Labs' (lighthouselabs.ca) Web Developer Bootcamp. A number of major and minor enhancements are sought, so with limited time to submit the project, a developer must decide which to implement.

These features have been implemented:
1)  A Sold Out badge is shown on any product whose stock level is zero,
2)  A user can add new product categories, and add products to categories.


## Dependencies

* Rails 4.2 [Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/v4.2/)
