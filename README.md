# Jungle

A mini e-commerce application built with Rails 4.2 for purposes of teaching Rails by example, and an assigned project during Lighthouse Labs' (lighthouselabs.ca) Web Developer Bootcamp. A number of major and minor enhancements are sought, so with limited time to submit the project, a developer must decide which to implement.

These features have been implemented:
1)  A Sold Out badge is shown on any product whose stock level is zero,
2)  A user can add new product categories, and add products to categories.
3)  A visitor can register (and continue) as a user; users can login or out, and the current user's displayed.

The next up is to provide more detail about Order, and the Order page and partials for its line items can be handled similarly to how a cart and its items are handled. However, I'll submit, do some current work, then come back to this, as Speed Dating's tomorrow (August 8th).
