# Jungle

A mini e-commerce application built with Rails 4.2 for purposes of teaching Rails by example, and an assigned project during Lighthouse Labs' (lighthouselabs.ca) Web Developer Bootcamp. Numerous major and minor enhancements are sought, so with limited time for the project, a developer decides which to implement.

These features have been implemented:
1)  A Sold Out badge is shown on any product whose stock level is zero,
2)  A user can add new product categories, and add products to categories.
3)  A visitor can register (and continue) as a user; users can login or out, and the current user's displayed.


See the Screenshots folder for an image which shows the Sold Out badge, an added product (a bike) in an added category (Transportation), the current logged in user (connie@munk.com), and a Logout link.


The next enhancement up is to provide more detail about Order: That Order page and partials for line items can be handled similarly to a cart and its items. However, I'll submit, do some current work, then come back to this, as Speed Dating in Victoria's tomorrow (August 8th).
